                There are three important mosques in islam they are majid al haram, masjid al nabawi and masjid al aqsa.
                <br> <br>
                Let's talk about them in brief below.

                Masjid al haram also known as the Sacred Mosque or the Great Mosque of Mecca, is a mosque enclosing the vicinity of the Kaaba in Mecca, in the Mecca Province of Saudi Arabia. It is a site of pilgrimage in the Hajj, which every Muslim must do at least once in their lives if able, and is also the main phase for the ʿUmrah, the lesser pilgrimage that can be undertaken any time of the year. The rites of both pilgrimages include circumambulating the Kaaba within the mosque. The Great Mosque includes other important significant sites, including the Black Stone, the Zamzam Well, Maqam Ibrahim, and the hills of Safa and Marwa.

                As of August 2020, the Great Mosque is both the largest mosque in the world, and the most expensive building in the world. It has undergone major renovations and expansions through the years. It has passed through the control of various caliphs, sultans and kings, and is now under the control of the King of Saudi Arabia who is titled the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.

                After arriving in Madinah, an overjoyed Muslim community welcomed Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). While every family asked the Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT to stay with them, Prophet’s she-camel al-Qaswa walked towards the south of Madinah.

When people tried to get hold of her, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, “Let her go her way, for she is under the command of Allah SWT.” 

Al-Qaswa kept walking until it stopped and knelt down in a large courtyard owned by two orphans, Suhayl and Sahil (RA). When the two boys learned that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) wanted to build a mosque on their land, they offered the land as a gift without a second thought.

However, because the boys were orphans, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and Abu Bakr (RA) bought the land for 10 dinars. After the purchase, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) exhumed the graves, cleared the shrubbery, and started constructing Masjid al Nabawi. 

Anas bin Malik (RA) narrates, “The location where the Prophet’s Mosque (PBUH) was built belonged to Banu Najjar. In it, there were date-palm trees and graves of the idolaters. The Prophet (PBUH) said to them: ‘Name its price.’ They said: ‘We will never take any money for it.’ The Prophet built (PBUH) it, and they were assisting him, and the Prophet (PBUH) was saying: ‘The real life is the life of the Hereafter, so forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirah.’ Before the mosque was built, the Prophet (PBUH) would perform prayer wherever he was when the time for prayer came.” [Narated in Sunan Ibn Majah]

                Masjid Al Aqsa was first built by Prophet Ibrahim (AS) but was demolished after the conquest of Jerusalem. The Farthest Mosque was then officially reconstructed for the first time on the orders of Abdul Malik ibn Marwan in 705 AD on top of the Temple Mount.

He passed away before the construction of the mosque was completed, and his son later continued the project and played an instrumental role in laying the foundation of Islam’s third-most important mosque.

However, an unfortunate earthquake in 748 AD ended up destroying the first structure of Masjid Al Aqsa. And so it was built again, only to be destroyed in 771 AD. The historical mosque was constructed once again in 780 AD but was brought to the ground by an earthquake in 1033 AD.

Following this, soon after the Crusaders took over in 1099 AD, they reconstructed Masjid Al Aqsa and made it their palace. It was later made the headquarters for the Templar Knights in 1119 AD. Masjid Al Aqsa was then renovated and reconstructed multiple times during the era of the Ottoman Empire.

Long story short, the architecture of Masjid Al Aqsa that we see today isn’t the same structure that was built hundreds of years ago. The Qibli Mosque has gone through several reconstructions throughout the years, with only one thing that remained the same – its location.
